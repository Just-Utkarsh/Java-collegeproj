# Sorting Visualizer – Java Application

A Java-based interactive application that demonstrates **multiple sorting algorithms**, lets users **view the code** for each algorithm, and **visualizes the sorting process in real time**. Designed as an educational tool, it helps learners understand how different algorithms work internally and how they compare in performance.

---


### 🔹 1. Multiple Sorting Techniques

The application includes visual and code-based demonstrations of:

* Bubble Sort
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
* Heap Sort
* (And any additional algorithms you implemented)

Each technique can be selected from the UI.

---

### 🔹 2. Built-in Code Viewer

Clicking on any sorting technique displays:

* Full Java implementation
* Clean and readable formatting
* Helps learners understand the logic behind the algorithm

---

### 🔹 3. Array Input Bar

You can enter an array manually (comma-separated), such as:

```
10, 3, 5, 7, 2
```

and the visualizer immediately loads the array for animation.

---

### 🔹 4. Real-Time Sorting Visualization

* Each algorithm is animated step-by-step
* Visual bars dynamically update during swaps and comparisons
* Slowed-down animations help beginners understand the algorithm flow
* Great for teaching or self-learning

---

### 🔹 5. Performance Comparison

The visualizer runs each algorithm on the same input and displays:

* Actual execution time (non-visual)
* Visual execution time (slowed for learning)
* Ranking based on speed
* Helps users understand time complexity in practice

---

### 🔹 6. Educational Breakdown

Along with visualization, the app also shows:

* How elements are compared
* When swaps occur
* Recursive or iterative flow (depending on algorithm)

This makes it easier to understand algorithm behavior beyond just pseudocode.

##  Technologies Used

* **Java** (Core Logic)
* **Swing / JavaFX** (for GUI and visualization)
* **OOP Principles**
* Threads for animation timing
* Algorithm-specific implementations
